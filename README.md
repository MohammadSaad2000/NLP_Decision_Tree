### NLP Decision Tree

1) make sure `main.py`, `attributes.py`, `decision_tree.py`, and the test and training `.txt` files are all in the same folder
2) in `main.py` under the driver code section, you can change the `max_depth` and `num_trials` vars to produce different results
3) run the program:
   1) run in command line by navigating to directory of `main.py` and typing `python main.py`
   2) or run in IDE
4) the program will run the evaluation routine (as specified in the project specs) and then show the results:
   1) a table with pairing between number of training examples & accuracy will be printed out
   2) a window will appear to show the graphed relationship between the number of training examples & accuracy
